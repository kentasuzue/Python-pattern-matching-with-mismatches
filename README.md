# Python-pattern-matching-with-mismatches
This Python program uses the Rabin-Karp Algorithm to find all instances of a pattern string in a longer text string, with up to k mismatches allowed.
Each line of input has, seperated by spaces, an integer k (the maximum number of mismatches), a longer string, and a shorter string.
Each line of output lists the number of times the shorter string appears in the longer string with up to k mismatches, and the position of every match.
